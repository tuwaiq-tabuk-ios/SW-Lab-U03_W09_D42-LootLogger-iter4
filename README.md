## Description
1. Fourth iteration of **LootLogger App** where the items data persists between runs.
2. Bronce challenge: **Throwing Errors**
   - Currently, the `saveChanges()` method returns a `Boo`l to indicate success or failure. It would be better if this method threw an error instead. 
   - Update `saveChanges()` to be a throwing method.
